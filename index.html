        <div class="subheading mb-5">Marketing ExecutiveðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Priscilla Cam and I am a first year college student majoring in pre-business at the University of California, Riverside. I plan to choose a concentration in either marketing or accounting. Moving forward, a few career options I have been thinking about include being a marketing executive, market research analyst, or an accountant like my mom. As for my past professional experience, the few most major things include having a part time job, tutoring younger children, and holding a position in certain organizations and clubs. 
<br>

        <br>The part time job I worked at was a swim center called Calphin Aquatic Club. I worked there as a swim instructor for about a year, teaching children ages three to twelve how to swim. During my time there, I gained many real life skills such as how to handle customers (angry parents), how to work cooperatively with other coworkers, how to work with children and keep them happy, and most importantly gaining realistic experience in the workforce. I worked there for a year, taking on shorter shifts during the school year. One of the most stressful experiences I had while working there was dealing with a parent who kept pressuring me about their childâ€™s improvement, accusing me for not putting in enough effort to help their child proceed. This encounter helped me figure out how to deal with customer satisfaction, even when I am not in the wrong. In the future, I will know how to move forward in a professional perspective while keeping the customer happy. Overall, I think that the most important skills I took away from this job were learning how to hold a real position that earned a wage, how to communicate within the work space, and the amount of work that I am expected to put into the job.
<br>

        <br>As for tutoring younger children, I simply helped out at an after school program that was looking for extra math tutors for elementary students. Although the material I taught was not too difficult, the experience is why I believe it is worth mentioning. Once again, working with children was a rewarding experience and taught me how to be super patient. I was able to excel in my tutoring skills mostly by observing how others taught, catching on to each personâ€™s different tactics and using them in my own way. Furthermore, in high school, I was a part of Key Club as well as an organization called Relay for Life that helped raise money for cancer patients. I was a part of Key Club for all four years, gaining the position of treasurer at one point. This club was an easy way to commit acts of service for the community, as well as helped me gain my service hours for my graduation requirement quickly. In Relay for Life, my team and I spent weeks planning the activities we would do the day of the event in order to raise the most money. It was a 24 hour event that helped raise thousands of dollars for a good purpose.
